## About Me
I’m a college student majoring in Software Engineering at Bowling Green State University. I'm also studying Japanese as my minor, and Linux as a hobby.

What I do:
 - Write code
 - Install and configure networking equipment
 - Manage hypervisors, and docker/k8s/rancher instances
 - Create usable software
 - Learn whatever technology is needed to complete a job


In my free time, I volunteer with the Findlay Civil Air Patrol, in emergency services and as an instructor to youth.

Thanks for reading!
