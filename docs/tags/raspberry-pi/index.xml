      <description>Introduction For my Robotics exam, I studied Python. While I already know the language fairly well, I was able to significantly deepen my knowledge of and capability within the language. Not only did this project improve my technical ability, but more importantly and more significantly, my soft skills.
The purpose of this library is to control Vex 393 motors using the MC29 motor controller with a Raspberry Pi, or other -like SBCs.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Introduction Hardware Software 10/10  Introduction I am building a roomba-like &amp;ldquo;vacuum&amp;rdquo; based on Vex hardware. It&amp;rsquo;s not really a vacuum, but a very strong magnet to pick up small pieces of metal off of the STEM lab floor.
The point of this is to learn all sorts of technologies relating to robotics, but also to struture a large program.
As far as the point of me logging this, it is more for myself.</description>
