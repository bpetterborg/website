This guide will show how to receive and decode the downlink of these satellites.
Roscosmos also operates METEOR satellites, which are relatively easy to receive and decode, which can be done with the same hardware, however this guide will not detail how to do this.</description>

Getting Started This guide assumes you already have a Hugo site. If you do not, you can learn how to here.
You will also need a Github Pages repo setup, these are pretty simple, and you can use this guide.</description>
