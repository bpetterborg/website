      <description>Introduction For my Robotics exam, I studied Python. While I already know the language fairly well, I was able to significantly deepen my knowledge of and capability within the language. Not only did this project improve my technical ability, but more importantly and more significantly, my soft skills.
The purpose of this library is to control Vex 393 motors using the MC29 motor controller with a Raspberry Pi, or other -like SBCs.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Introduction Hardware Software 10/10  Introduction I am building a roomba-like &amp;ldquo;vacuum&amp;rdquo; based on Vex hardware. It&amp;rsquo;s not really a vacuum, but a very strong magnet to pick up small pieces of metal off of the STEM lab floor.
The point of this is to learn all sorts of technologies relating to robotics, but also to struture a large program.
As far as the point of me logging this, it is more for myself.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Introduction Getting Started Receiving Decoding What to do Next Additional Resources  Introduction NOAA has weather satellites that are easy to receive with basic and inexpensive equipment. This guide will show how to receive and decode the downlink of these satellites.
Roscosmos also operates METEOR satellites, which are relatively easy to receive and decode, which can be done with the same hardware, however this guide will not detail how to do this.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Introduction Getting Started Prepare your environment Building your site  Introduction I had a bit of difficulty setting up Hugo to work with Github Pages, so I decided to document how I was able to make it work.
Getting Started This guide assumes you already have a Hugo site. If you do not, you can learn how to here.
You will also need a Github Pages repo setup, these are pretty simple, and you can use this guide.</description>
