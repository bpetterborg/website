This guide will show how to receive and decode the downlink of these satellites.\nRoscosmos also operates METEOR satellites, which are relatively easy to receive and decode, which can be done with the same hardware, however this guide will not detail how to do this.\nWe will be using NOAA-15, NOAA-18, and NOAA-19, on the APT downlink as these are analog FM with a λ = ~2.2 meters, which is very easy to work with.\nGetting Started Software You will need an SDR program, like CubicSDR (which I will be using for this), however other programs, such as GQRX, SDR#, SDR++, or SigDigger will also work.\nIf you are using an Android phone or tablet, I recommend RF-Analyzer\nYou will also need a program to decode the audio. I will use NOAA APT\nHardware I recommend the RTL-SDR kit, it as a adjustable and portable dipole antenna, an RG-174 extension cable, and the dongle itself.\nYou will also need a laptop, an Android phone, or a tablet. Brighter screens are better since you will be outside.\nReceieving A few minutes before the satellite will be above, setup your antenna. Each element of the dipole should be ~53cm long, 120° apart, with \u0026lsquo;V\u0026rsquo; facing south. The center conductor of the coax should be connected to the element facing right. If it\u0026rsquo;s not, simply flip the antenna over.\nOpen CubicSDR and select RTL2832U, RTL-SDR, or something else that starts with \u0026lsquo;Realtek\u0026rsquo;. Tune your receiver to the appropriate satellite, per the table below.\n   Satellite Freq. (MHz)      NOAA-15 137.61    NOAA-18 137.91    NOAA-19 137.1     Set the demodulator to WFM (Wide FM), and the receive bandwidth to ~40kHz, to account for doppler shift.\nUnder recording, set the path, and the squelch to \u0026lsquo;Record Always\u0026rsquo;. Begin the recording ~1 minute before the satellite will pass over. It\u0026rsquo;ll take ~15min, so have something to keep yourself occupied.\nOnce the satellite passes over the horizon and the signal fades away, you can go ahead and stop the recording.\nDecoding Open NOAA APT and open your file. You can skip through the rest of the menus, then save the image.\nCongrats! You\u0026rsquo;ve pulled images directly from weather satellites in orbit!\nWhat to do Next If you enjoyed this, you may also want to try receiving METEOR, GOES, or HRPT. These both use digital downlinks, which are a bit harder to work with, however they provide much higher-resolution color imagery.\nGOES satellites are in geostationary orbits, which allow them to provide \u0026lsquo;full- disk\u0026rsquo; (i.e. a picture of the whole earth).\nAmateur satcom is a fun hobby and gives you bragging rights to say you\u0026rsquo;ve downloaded images directly off of weather satellites in orbit.\nAdditional Resources Lesson Plan RTL-SDR Blog\n","id":0,"section":"posts","summary":"Table of Contents  Introduction Getting Started Receiving Decoding What to do Next Additional Resources  Introduction NOAA has weather satellites that are easy to receive with basic and inexpensive equipment.
